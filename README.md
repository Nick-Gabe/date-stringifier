Date Stringifier is a package created exclusively for Date Formatting. Trying to be simple and direct as possible.

## üöÄ How To install:
```
npm install date-stringifier
```

## üìö How to use:
First you will need to import the package.

Then you can use it as a function, passing a Date created using the [Date Constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date), and how you want the formatted output to be. You can use [Date variables](#dateVariables) in your string, as shown in the example below:
```javascript
const dateStringifier = require('date-stringifier')
const date = new Date(1995, 11, 17)

console.log(dateStringifier(date, '{DD}/{MM}/{yyyy}'))
// It will print 17/12/1995
// *Months are zero indexed, so it adds one
```
You can also specify the language you want the result to be, if you don't specify, it will be set to English by default. The available languages are:
- `en` - English
- `pt` - Portuguese
```javascript
const date = new Date()
const english = dateStringifier(date, 'Today is the {oDD} day of {month}', 'en')
// Today is the 25th day of June
const portuguese = dateStringifier(date, 'Hoje √© o {oDD} dia de {month}', 'pt')
// Hoje √© o 25¬∫ dia de Junho
```

<h2 id="dateVariables"> üìÖ Date Variables </h2>

Date variables are the ones you use to insert something based on the date you passed to the function. For example, every `{yyyy}` in your string will be replaced by the Date's year (1995).

Any text that is not between brackets "`{}`" will not be considered as a variable, therefore it won't change in the final result.

These are the Date variables you can use in your string:

**They are case-sensitive.*
