# *Date Stringify*

Date Stringify is a package created exclusively for Date Formatting. Trying to be simple and direct as possible.

## üöÄ How To install:
```
npm install date-stringify
```

## üìö How to use:
First you will need to import the package.

Then you can use it as a function, passing a Date created using the [Date Constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date), and how you want the formatted output to be. You can use [Date variables](#dateVariables) in your string, as shown in the example below:
```javascript
const dateStringify = require('date-stringify')
const date = new Date(1995, 11, 17)

console.log(dateStringify(date, '{DD}/{MM}/{yyyy}')
// It will print 17/12/1995
// *Months are zero indexed, so it adds one
```

<h2 id="dateVariables"> üìÖ Date Variables </h2>

Date variables are the ones you use to insert something based on the date you passed to the function. For example, every `{yyyy}` in your string will be replaced by the Date's year (1995).

Any text that is not between brackets "`{}`" will not be considered as a variable, therefore it won't change in the final result.

These are the Date variables you can use in your string:

**They are case-sensitive.*
